# create-stimuli

Please fill in the directories in `directories.py`.

To run with a ratio of, e.g., 0.17 send the `-r` flag followed by `0.17`:
```
python create_stimuli.py -r 0.17
```

Once the script has run, the stimuli will be in the directory you have chosen along with a CSV file: `stimuli.csv`, which contains useful details per stimulus.
